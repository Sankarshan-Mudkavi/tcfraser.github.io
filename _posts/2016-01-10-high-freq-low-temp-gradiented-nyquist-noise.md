latex: mathjax-autonumber
---

For any given conductor at constant temperature $T$ with resitance $R$, there is both voltage and current noise generated by the thermo agitation of the electrons inside the conductor. Nyquist gives us a nice formula for the root-mean-squared noise within a given band of frequency $\Delta F$. However, what about conductors at high-frequencies and low, non-constant temperatures?

## Nyquist Noise

For a given resistor with resistance $R$ at a constant temperature $T$, Nyquist[^nyquist] obtains the general result for thermal voltage and current noise to be:

[^nyquist]: H. Nyquist. Thermal agitation of electric charge in conductors. *Phys. Rev.*, 32:110â€“113, Jul 1928.

$$
\begin{align}
    \nu_{N,rms} = \sqrt{\ba{\nu_N^2}} &= \sqrt{\f{4hfR\Delta f}{e^{hf/k_b T} - 1}} \label{nyquist noise}\\
    i_{N,rms} = \sqrt{\ba{i_N^2}} &= \sqrt{\f{4hf\Delta f}{R\br{e^{hf/k_b T} - 1}}}
\end{align}
$$

where $k_b$ is Boltzmann's constant and $\Delta f$ is the frequency range in which the noise is produced.

In situations where the the frequencies of interest $f$ is very low and the tempertaure $T$ is very high, Nyquist uses the approximation:

$$
\begin{align}
    \nu_{N,rms} = \sqrt{\ba{\nu_N^2}} &= \sqrt{4k_bTR\Delta f} \label{nyquist noise approx}\\
    i_{N,rms} = \sqrt{\ba{i_N^2}} &= \sqrt{\f{4k_bT\Delta f}{R}}
\end{align}
$$

## Temperature Gradient

Consider one sub section of conductor has a simple filiform conductor with some aribitrary temperature function $T(x)$ with boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{align}
    \begin{split} 
        T(x_\alpha) &= \Ta \\
        T(x_\beta) &= \Tb \\
    \end{split}
    \label{temperature boundary}
\end{align}
$$

$T(x)$ must satistfy the heat equation

$$ \pder{T}{t} - \alpha\del^2 T = 0 $$

By assumption that the conductor has reached a steady state $\pder{T}{t} = 0$:

$$ \del^2 T = 0 $$

By symmetry along the axis of the filiform conductor, $\pder{T}{y} = 0$, 
$\pder{T}{z} = 0$ and thus:

$$ \del^2 T = 0 \implies \dder{T}{x} = 0 $$

Therefore, it can be seen that the trivial solution for $T(x)$ is:

$$ T(x) = Ax + B $$

Using boundary conditions $\eqref{temperature boundary}$:

$$
\begin{equation}
T(x) = \f{\Tb - \Ta}{l}x + \Ta \label{temperature}
\end{equation}
$$

Where $$l = x_\beta - x_\alpha$$ is the length of the conductor.

## Partitioning The Conductor

Consider a conductor as described above paritioned into $k$ pieces all sharing an equal length of $l/k$. The intention being that $k$ will be sufficiently large to assume the following for each piece $i$:


1. There is a corresponding *constant* resistance $R_i$.
2. There is a corresponding *constant* temperature $T_i$ approximated by one end of piece $i$.
3. The voltage noise generated is $$\nu_{N,i}$$ and it's root-mean-squared is measured as $$\sqrt{\ba{\nu_{N,i}^2}} = \sqrt{4k_bT_iR_i\Delta f}$$.


By construction, these $k$ pieces form the entire conductor connected in series. Thus:

$$ R = \sum_{i=1}^{k} R_i $$

$$ \nu_N = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \nu_{N,i} $$

## Uncorelated Noisy Resistors

In order to determine how the noise generated by each of the individual pieces combine to form $\ba{\nu_N^2}$, the sum must be expanded:

$$
\begin{align}
    \ba{\nu_N^2}
    &= \ba{\br{\sum_{i=1}^k \nu_{N,i}}^2} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\br{\sum_{i=1}^k \nu_{N,i}}\br{\sum_{j=1}^k \nu_{N,j}}} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\br{\sum_{i=1}^k \nu_{N,i}}\br{\nu_{N,i} + \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,j}}} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \bs{\nu_{N,i} \br{\nu_{N,i} + \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,j}}}} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \bs{\nu_{N,i}^2 + \nu_{N,i} \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,j}}} && \nu_{N,i} \text{ acts as a constant.}\notag \\
    &= \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \bs{\nu_{N,i}^2 + \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}}} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \nu_{N,i}^2 + \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}} \notag \\
    &= \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \nu_{N,i}^2} + \ba{\sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}} \notag \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k \ba{\nu_{N,i}^2} + \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{j = 1, j \neq i}^k\ba{\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}} \label{noise reduction}
\end{align}
$$

Using the idea that different resistor pieces $i$ and $j$ produce noise that is uncorelated to each other:

$$
\begin{align*}
    0   &= \text{cov}\br{\nu_{N,i}, \nu_{N,j}} && \text{By definition.} \\
        &= \ba{\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}} - \cancelto{0}{\ba{\nu_{N,i}}} \cancelto{0}{\ba{\nu_{N,j}}} \\
\end{align*}
$$

The term $$\ba{\nu_{N,i}}$$ equals $0$ because the noise produces no net voltage averaged over time. Therefore $$\ba{\nu_{N,i}\cdot\nu_{N,j}} = 0$$. Combining this result with \eqref{noise reduction}, and it can be seen that,

$$ \ba{\nu_N^2} = \sum_{i=1}^k \ba{\nu_{N,i}^2}$$

## High Temperature, Low Frequency

Working with assumption that the temperature of the conductor is very large and the frequency of the voltage source is very low, the term ${h f}/{k_b T}$ becomes very small making Nyquist's approximate form for thermal noise (equation \eqref{nyquist noise approx}) applicable.

$$
\begin{equation}
\ba{\nu_N^2} = \sum_{i=1}^k \ba{\nu_{N,i}^2} = \sum_{i=1}^k 4k_bT_iR_i\Delta f \label{noise sum} 
\end{equation}
$$

Each $R_i$ can in principle have it's own value. Specifically, the resistance of an conductor depends of the resistivity of the material at a given temperature. Since each $R_i$ has an associated $T_i$, the resistances $R_i$ should all be dependent on $T_i$. A common practice is to linearize the resistance about a specific reference temperature.

$$
\begin{equation}
R(T) \approx R_{T_0} \bs{1 + \f{1}{R_{T_0}}\bs{\pder{R}{T}}_{T=T_0} \br{T - T_0}} \label{resistance and temperature}
\end{equation}
$$

Where $T_0$ is the reference temperature chosen near the temperature region of interest and $R_T$ is the measured temperature at that $T_0$.

However for this case, it will be assumed that $\Ta \approx \Tb$ and that each $R_i$ equals $R_0$ some constant. Therefore

$$
\begin{gather}
    R = \sum_{i=1}^{k} R_i = \sum_{i=1}^{k} R_0 = k \cdot R_0 \notag \\
    R_0 = \f{R}{k} \label{Ri}
\end{gather}
$$

Since it has been established that each $T_i$ is a constant value along piece $i$, and can be approximated by one end of piece $i$, knowing equation \eqref{temperature} leads to an obvious value to choose:

$$
\begin{equation}
T_i = \f{i}{k} \br{\Tb - \Ta}  + \Ta \label{Ti} 
\end{equation}
$$

Combining \eqref{noise sum} with \eqref{Ri} and \eqref{Ti}:

$$
\begin{align}
    \ba{\nu_N^2}
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k 4k_bT_iR_i\Delta f  \notag \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k 4k_bT_i\f{R}{k}\Delta f  \notag \\
    &= 4k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \sum_{i=1}^k T_i \notag \\
    &= 4k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \sum_{i=1}^k \br{\f{i}{k} \br{\Tb - \Ta}  + \Ta} \notag \\
    &= 4k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \br{\f{k^2 + k}{2} \f{\br{\Tb - \Ta}}{k}  + k\Ta} && \text{Cancel the $k$.} \notag \\
    &= 4k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \br{\f{k + 1}{2} \br{\Tb - \Ta}  + k\Ta} \notag \\
    &= 4k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \br{\f{k\Tb}{2} + \f{\Tb}{2} - \f{k\Ta}{2} - \f{\Ta}{2} + k\Ta}  \notag \\
    &= \cancelto{2}{4}k_b\f{R}{k}\Delta f \cancel{\br{\f{1}{2}}} \br{\br{\Tb - \Ta} + k\br{\Tb + \Ta}}  \notag \\
    &= 2k_bR\Delta f \br{\br{\f{\Tb - \Ta}{k}} + \br{\Tb + \Ta}} && \text{Letting $k \rightarrow \infty$} \notag \\
    &= 2k_bR\Delta f \br{\Tb + \Ta} \label{approx noise result}\\
\end{align}
$$

This result is represents the noise generated by a conductor with resistance $R$ with boundary conditions \eqref{temperature boundary} in the high temperature, low frequency approximation. Setting $\Ta = \Tb = T$ reproduces Nyquists original result \eqref{nyquist noise approx} as expected. Effectively, this result indicates that the noise generated by a resistor with a varying temperature along it's length is equivalent to the noise generated by an identical resistor at a fixed temperature $T$ equal to the average temperature of the original resistor.

## Low Temperature, High Frequency

For situations where the frequency range of interest is very high and the temperatures near absolute zero, result \eqref{approx noise result} is not helpful. Instead, equation \eqref{nyquist noise} needs to used in place of equation \eqref{nyquist noise approx}.

$$
\begin{align*}
    \ba{\nu_N^2}
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k \ba{\nu_{N,i}^2} \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k \f{4hfR_i\Delta f}{e^{hf/k_b T_i} - 1} \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^k \f{4hf\f{R}{k}\Delta f}{e^{hf/k_b T_i} - 1} \\
    &= \f{4hfR\Delta f}{k} \sum_{i=1}^k \f{1}{e^{hf/k_b T_i} - 1} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Setting up an integral as $k \rightarrow \infty$ in $T$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
    f(T) = \f{1}{e^{hf/k_b T} - 1} \\
    T_i = \f{i}{k} \br{\Tb - \Ta}  + \Ta \\
    \Delta T_i = \f{\Tb - \Ta}{k} \implies \f{1}{k} = \f{\Delta T_i}{\Tb - \Ta}\\
\end{gather*}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
    \ba{\nu_N^2}
    &= \f{4hfR\Delta f}{\Tb - \Ta} \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^k f(T_i) \Delta T_i \notag \\
    &= \f{4hfR\Delta f}{\Tb - \Ta} \intl_{\Ta}^{\Tb} \f{1}{e^{hf/k_b T} - 1} \dif T \label{noise result}\\
\end{align}
$$

This result cannot be carried further and is up to numerical analysis to determine practical results.

## Varying Resistance

One important factor that was left out was the idea that resistance varies with temperature as outlined in \eqref{resistance and temperature}. If this were to be considered, the result \eqref{noise result} would only need slight modification:

$$ \ba{\nu_N^2} = \f{4hfR\Delta f}{\Tb - \Ta} \intl_{\Ta}^{\Tb} \f{\gamma_R \br{T-\Ta} + R_\alpha}{e^{hf/k_b T} - 1} \dif T $$

Where

$$ \gamma_R = \pder{R}{T}_{T=T_0} = \f{R_\beta - R_\alpha}{\Tb - \Ta} $$

and $$R_\alpha$$ and $$R_\beta$$ represent the measured resistances at the ends of the conductor.
