Say for example, you have an arbitrary set of distinct elements $S$ with  at least two elements and a relation $f: S \times S \mapsto \bc{\text{true}, \text{false}}$ that compares two distinct elements. This relation $f$ can be used to order the elements of $S$.

Less abstractly, an example of this is the case where $S$ is $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers and $f$ is the comparison operator. For example,

$$ \ldots < -2 < -1 < 0 < 1 < 2 < \ldots$$

This is called the usual ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$. Of course, one can construct other orderings but this one is particularly nice because it's transitive.

A given ordering on a set S can
