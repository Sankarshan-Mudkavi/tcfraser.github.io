My name is officially *Thomas Coolican Fraser*, however everyone calls me by my first two initials *TC*. I am currently studying Mathematical Physics at the University of Waterloo. I'm really interesting in all sorts of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science. Long term I hope to become a theoretical physicist.

This blog is intended to be a place for me to write down things I'm interested in. Most often, my target audience is my future self. Some of my posts are original ideas; some are summaries of concepts I've learned explained in a way I understand them best. 

Feel free to read through my [Posts](/). Thanks!
